## How to make Requests

### Get Requests
In a broad sense, “fake” news contains information that is false or exaggerated beyond objective facts. Fake news articles tend to contain language that is opinionated and biased towards one viewpoint in order to promote a political agenda or to generate views for advertising.

### Post Requests
By honing in on the language that tends to be used in “real” and “fake” news articles, the detector is able to calculate the probability of the article being from a factual source. 
*Note: this does not imply that the detector verifies actual claims in the articles. It primarily suspects the article of being biased or not.
